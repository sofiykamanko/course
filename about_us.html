   <p>February 24 would have been an ordinary day in the life of every Ukrainian, if early in the morning Russian troops had not crossed the borders of our country and struck unexpectedly. For each person, this day was the beginning of a terrible story that is still going on. Every child who faces the realities of war will never forget it and it greatly affects her/his mental health. The founding of our course, unfortunately, is not associated with positive events, but we try to bring at least a little happy emotions into the lives of students along with science.</p>

    <h4>About Us</h4>
    <p>My name is Sofiya and I am 14. I finished the 9th grade.I am a student of the Physics and Mathematics Lyceum. I have always been fascinated by exact sciences and find them extremely interesting. It seems to me that with the correct presentation of the material and excellent explanations, everyone can understand these sciences. This year, Ukrainian students faced the terrible realities of war, but even in such a time, we must all develop, learn to live on and not forget that the future of Ukraine is in hands of youth. In cooperation with teachers and professors, we established a physics course. And we are waiting for you!
