       <h2>Online Programs For 2022</h2>               <p>We offer you a large list of interesting online courses. You can choose the one that interests you. Also, it is possible to choose several courses at the same time, because schedules are always built in such a way that students can attend any number of courses (For those who are particularly interested, it is possible to conduct additional classes). </p>           <p>Courses also differ in the level of difficulty, but they can be on the same course. both 7th and 8th grade students, because there are no age restrictions. Also, the courses can be attended not only by students of grades 7-8, but also those who want to learn, however, if you want to choose a course that includes the program of grade 8, you need to have at least a superficial understanding of topics for grade 7.</p>         
     <p>Also, we need to have contact with students, because it is important for every teacher to see the work of students. Therefore, choosing a certain course, you should be prepared for the fact that you have to do at least a little homework and keep in touch with the teacher.</p>

    <h4>About Us</h4>
    <p>My name is Sofiya and I am 14. I finished the 9th grade.I am a student of the Physics and Mathematics Lyceum. I have always been fascinated by exact sciences and find them extremely interesting. It seems to me that with the correct presentation of the material and excellent explanations, everyone can understand these sciences. This year, Ukrainian students faced the terrible realities of war, but even in such a time, we must all develop, learn to live on and not forget that the future of Ukraine is in hands of youth. In cooperation with teachers and professors, we established a physics course. And we are waiting for you!
