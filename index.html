      <h1><br><br><br>Physics training course</h1>
      <p>My name is Sofia Manko and I am 14. This year, my teachers and I decided to create an online physics course for grades 7-8, since education in many schools in Ukraine has been suspended due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
      </p>

    <h1> Courses We Offer</h1>
    <p>What topics do we study? Where to start? Is it worth buying our course? How does our training system work?</p>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="course-col">
        <h3>Mechanics</h3>
        <p>The first section of physics is, obviously, mechanics. We study in depth the movement of bodies in nature and superficially study intermediate topics.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="course-col">
        <h3>Forces of nature</h3>
        <p>An extremely important section of physics is the section on the forces of nature. There are many of them: the force of gravity, the force of friction, the force of the normal reaction of the support, the force of elasticity, the force of resistance, the force of Archimedes, the force of pressure, etc. Are you ready to learn a lot of interesting things about each of them?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="course-col">
        <h3>Electrostatics</h3>
        <p>How does the light bulb work? How does the current flow? What does the amount of current depend on? You will learn all this while studying the third topic of our course. Many practical experiments related to electrical objects await you.</p>

  <section class="experiment">
    <h1> Unique experiments</h1>
    <p>We set ourselves the task of making learning interesting, filled with many interesting practical activities, and not just theory.</p>

                <p>I am very glad that I bought this course, because the teachers I worked with explained the material clearly and interestingly. I really liked the experiments, which I had to watch more than once (I later repeated many of them on my own). Therefore, I do not campaign, but invite to this course and can only give positive feedback.</p>

                <p>I've had a lot of physics-related questions lately, so I figured it out. that I need to study physics additionally. I never once regretted it, because I got a lot of emotions, knowledge. Teachers are loyal to students, never forget anyone and quickly check homework.</p>

    <h4>About Us</h4>
    <p>My name is Sofiya and I am 14. I finished the 9th grade.I am a student of the Physics and Mathematics Lyceum. I have always been fascinated by exact sciences and find them extremely interesting. It seems to me that with the correct presentation of the material and excellent explanations, everyone can understand these sciences. This year, Ukrainian students faced the terrible realities of war, but even in such a time, we must all develop, learn to live on and not forget that the future of Ukraine is in hands of youth. In cooperation with teachers and professors, we established a physics course. And we are waiting for you!
